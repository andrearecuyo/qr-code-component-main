## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Working with this project taught me how to work without any designing tools like Figma. It forced me to code CSS by identifying the details of the design. 

An example is learning how to use CSS Box Shadow.
```css
.qr-box {
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(31, 50, 81, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(31, 50, 81, 0.19);
}
```
### Continued development

In continuation of this project, below is the list I would like to implement.

- Automatic QR Code Generator
    - Text
    - URL
    - Email
    - Number
- Night Mode Version

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me understand CSS Box Shadow.
